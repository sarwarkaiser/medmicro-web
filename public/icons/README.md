# App Icons

## Quick Setup (Automatic)

Run this command to generate all required icon sizes:

```bash
npm run generate-icons
```

This will create all icons from the base icon.svg file.

## Manual Setup (If you have a logo image)

If you have your own logo image (PNG or SVG), use an online PWA icon generator:

1. Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload your logo image
3. Download the generated icons
4. Extract them to this `icons/` directory

## Required Icon Sizes

- 72x72px
- 96x96px
- 128x128px
- 144x144px
- 152x152px
- 192x192px
- 384x384px
- 512x512px

## Temporary Placeholder

For development, we'll use a simple placeholder icon. Replace these with your actual brand icons before production deployment.
