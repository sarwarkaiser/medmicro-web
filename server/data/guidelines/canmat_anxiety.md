# CANMAT Anxiety Disorders 2014 Guidelines

## Overview
These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of anxiety disorders, PTSD, and OCD in adults, updated to reflect current evidence.

## Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

### First-Line Pharmacotherapy
- **SSRIs**: Escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline (Level 1 evidence)
- **SNRIs**: Venlafaxine XR, duloxetine (Level 1 evidence)
- **Other**: Pregabalin (Level 1)

### Second-Line
- Buspirone (Level 1)
- Bupropion XL (Level 2)
- Hydroxyzine (Level 2)
- Benzodiazepines (short-term only — Level 1 for symptom relief, risk of dependence)

### First-Line Psychotherapy
- Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) — Level 1
- Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) — Level 2

---

## Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)

### First-Line Pharmacotherapy
- **SSRIs**: Escitalopram, fluvoxamine CR, paroxetine/CR, sertraline (Level 1)
- **SNRIs**: Venlafaxine XR (Level 1)

### Second-Line
- Gabapentin (Level 2)
- Pregabalin (Level 2)
- MAOIs: Phenelzine (Level 1 but tolerability concerns)
- Mirtazapine (Level 2)

### First-Line Psychotherapy
- CBT with exposure — Level 1

---

## Panic Disorder

### First-Line Pharmacotherapy
- **SSRIs**: Citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline (Level 1)
- **SNRIs**: Venlafaxine XR (Level 1)

### Prescribing Pearls
- Start at low dose (e.g., sertraline 12.5-25 mg) — panic patients are sensitive to initial activation
- Allow 4-6 weeks at therapeutic dose before assessing response
- Benzodiazepines may bridge early SSRI side effects but carry dependence risk

---

## OCD

### First-Line Pharmacotherapy
- **SSRIs** (high dose required): Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline (Level 1)
- Escitalopram (Level 2)

### Second-Line
- Clomipramine (Level 1 — more effective but more side effects)
- Combination: SSRI + antipsychotic augmentation (aripiprazole, risperidone — Level 1)

### Prescribing Principles
- Higher doses required than for depression: sertraline up to 200-300 mg, fluoxetine up to 80 mg
- 10-12 weeks at therapeutic dose before assessing efficacy
- Duration: minimum 1-2 years, often lifelong

### First-Line Psychotherapy
- CBT with ERP (Exposure and Response Prevention) — Level 1 (most effective)

---

## Key Principles
1. Combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy superior to either alone
2. Treat for minimum 12 months after remission before considering discontinuation
3. Monitor for suicidality during initial antidepressant therapy
4. Benzodiazepines: short-term adjuncts only; avoid long-term prescribing
