# CADDRA Canadian ADHD Practice Guidelines 2020

## Overview
Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ADHD across the lifespan, with specific guidance for Canadian clinical practice.

## Diagnosis

### Core Principles
- ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder requiring symptom onset before age 12
- Diagnosis is clinical — no single test or biomarker confirms ADHD
- Symptoms must be present in ≥2 settings and cause functional impairment

### Assessment Tools
- **Adults**: ASRS v1.1 (Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale), Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS)
- **Children**: Conners' 3, SNAP-IV
- Neuropsychological testing: not required for diagnosis but helpful for differential and academic planning
- Collateral history essential (parent, partner, teacher reports)

## Pharmacotherapy

### First-Line: Stimulants

#### Long-Acting Methylphenidate
- **Concerta** (OROS): 18, 27, 36, 54 mg — ~12-hour coverage
- **Biphentin**: 10-80 mg — ~10-12-hour coverage
- **Foquest**: 25-85 mg — ~16-hour coverage (longest duration)
- **Ritalin LA**: 10-40 mg — ~8-hour coverage
- Starting dose: 18-36 mg (adults)

#### Long-Acting Amphetamine
- **Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine)**: 30-70 mg — ~14-hour coverage
- **Adderall XR**: 5-30 mg BID — (not as commonly used in Canada)

#### Short-Acting (IR) Options
- Methylphenidate IR 5-20 mg TID — useful for afternoon coverage booster
- Dexedrine IR 5-10 mg BID

### Titration Principles
- Titrate weekly or bi-weekly based on response and tolerability
- Assess with validated rating scales at each visit
- Target: symptom control without impairing side effects
- Do NOT dose for tolerability — if intolerable, switch formulation or class

### Cardiovascular Monitoring
- Baseline BP, HR
- Repeat at each dose change and annually when stable
- ECG if: personal/family history of cardiac disease, congenital abnormality, arrhythmia

### Second-Line: Non-Stimulants

#### Atomoxetine (Strattera)
- SNRI — selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
- Dose: 40-100 mg/day (adults); start 40 mg x 4 weeks, then ↑ to 80-100 mg
- 4-6 weeks for full effect
- No abuse potential — useful in substance use disorders
- Monitor for suicidal ideation, hepatotoxicity, urinary retention

#### Bupropion (Wellbutrin XL) — Off-label
- Useful when ADHD + MDD comorbidity
- 150-300 mg/day
- Level 2 evidence for ADHD

#### Clonidine / Guanfacine — alpha-2 agonists
- Primarily for ADHD with comorbid tics, aggression, or insomnia
- Guanfacine ER (Intuniv): 1-4 mg/day
- Not first-line for adults

## Psychosocial Interventions
- CBT for ADHD (adult): organization, time management, emotional regulation
- Coaching
- Psychoeducation for patient and family
- Academic/workplace accommodations

## Monitoring and Follow-Up
- Monthly initially, then every 3-6 months when stable
- Assess: symptom control, side effects, BP/HR, sleep, appetite, mood
- Drug holidays: consider during academic breaks (not recommended routinely in adults)
- Controlled substance monitoring: Watch for diversion

---

## Special Populations

### Women
- Hormonal fluctuations affect symptom severity and medication response
- ADHD may be under-recognized and undertreated in women
- Adjust dosing around menstrual cycle, perimenopause

### Substance Use Disorders
- ADHD significantly increases SUD risk
- Treat ADHD — untreated ADHD worsens SUD outcomes
- Prefer non-stimulant or extended-release stimulants
- Close monitoring; consider urine drug screening

---

## Key Principles
1. Stimulants are first-line — safe, effective, and well-studied
2. ADHD is chronic — anticipate long-term treatment
3. Multimodal treatment: medication + psychosocial interventions
4. Screen for comorbidities (MDD, anxiety, bipolar, SUD, learning disorders)
5. Regularly reassess benefit vs. side effects
