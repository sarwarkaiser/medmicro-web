# NICE NG116 — PTSD Guideline 2018

## Overview
NICE guideline on the recognition, assessment and treatment of PTSD in adults and children.

## Key Recommendations

### Trauma-Focused Psychological Therapies (First-Line)

#### Trauma-Focused CBT (TF-CBT)
- First-line for adults with PTSD
- Include exposure and/or cognitive restructuring elements
- 8-12 sessions (may extend to 12-16 for complex presentations)

#### EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)
- First-line for adults with PTSD
- Offer 8-12 sessions; if trauma is severe/complex, more may be needed
- Recommended alongside TF-CBT as equivalent alternatives

---

### Pharmacotherapy

#### When to Use Pharmacotherapy
- When psychological interventions are declined or not possible
- As adjunct for severe symptoms or comorbid depression
- NOT as routine first-line monotherapy for PTSD in NICE guidelines (unlike CANMAT)

#### Recommended Agents
- **Venlafaxine** (SNRI) — if pharmacotherapy indicated
- **Paroxetine** — if pharmacotherapy indicated
- Do NOT routinely offer other antidepressants, antipsychotics, or benzodiazepines

#### What NOT to Use
- Benzodiazepines — do not prescribe for PTSD symptom relief
- Antipsychotics — not recommended unless comorbid psychosis
- Hypnotics — limit to short-term use for acute sleep disturbance only

## Watchful Waiting
- For mild symptoms or symptoms <4 weeks post-trauma, consider watchful waiting with follow-up in 1 month
- Brief stabilization-focused interventions first

## Complex PTSD
- Consider phased treatment approach
- Address stabilization and emotion regulation before trauma processing
- DBT or specialist psychological intervention for severe affect dysregulation

## Children and Young People
- Trauma-focused CBT adapted for age
- Involve parents/carers
- Pharmacotherapy not recommended for CYP as primary treatment

---

## Service Delivery
- PTSD services should be accessible, trauma-informed
- Consider barriers to access (stigma, cultural factors, transport)
- Monitor outcomes using PCL-5 or IES-R

---

## Key Differences from CANMAT
- NICE is more restrictive with pharmacotherapy (psychotherapy preferred)
- CANMAT allows SSRIs as equivalent first-line alongside psychotherapy
- NICE specifically recommends venlafaxine and paroxetine; CANMAT includes sertraline and fluoxetine
