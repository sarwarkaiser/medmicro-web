# BAP Evidence-Based Guidelines for Treating Bipolar Disorder

## Acute Mania

### First-Line Treatments (Evidence Level A):
1. **Antipsychotics**:
   - Quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, paliperidone, asenapine
   - Haloperidol (typical, but effective)

2. **Mood Stabilizers**:
   - Valproate (avoid in women of childbearing potential - teratogenic)
   - Lithium (may take 1-2 weeks for antimanic effect)

3. **Combination Therapy**:
   - Lithium or valproate + antipsychotic (superior to monotherapy)

### Second-Line:
- Carbamazepine
- ECT (for severe or treatment-resistant mania)

### Avoid:
- Antidepressant monotherapy (can worsen mania)

## Acute Bipolar Depression

### First-Line (Evidence Level A):
1. **Quetiapine** (300-600 mg/day)
2. **Lurasidone** (20-120 mg with food)
3. **Lamotrigine** (gradual titration; works for prevention, not acute)
4. **Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination** (OFC)

### Second-Line:
- Lithium (therapeutic levels 0.6-1.0 mEq/L)
- Valproate
- Cariprazine

### Adjunctive Strategies:
- Add antidepressant (SSRI or bupropion) to mood stabilizer (NOT monotherapy)
- Psychological therapies (CBT, IPSRT)

### Avoid Antidepressant Monotherapy:
- Risk of switching to mania/hypomania
- Always combine with mood stabilizer or antipsychotic

## Maintenance Treatment

### Goals:
- Prevent mood episodes (both manic and depressive)
- Continue at least 2 years after first episode; indefinitely after multiple episodes

### First-Line for Maintenance (Evidence Level A):
1. **Lithium** (most evidence; reduces suicide risk)
2. **Quetiapine**
3. **Valproate**
4. **Lamotrigine** (especially for bipolar depression prevention)
5. **Aripiprazole, olanzapine**

### Combination Maintenance:
- Lithium + valproate
- Lithium or valproate + antipsychotic
- Superior to monotherapy in many patients

### Monitoring Requirements:
- **Lithium**: Levels every 3-6 months; renal function, thyroid, calcium annually
- **Valproate**: LFTs, CBC, consider levels
- **Antipsychotics**: Metabolic monitoring (weight, glucose, lipids), prolactin, movement disorders

## Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder

### Definition:
≥4 mood episodes per year

### Treatment:
1. Optimize mood stabilizer (lithium or valproate)
2. Add lamotrigine or second-generation antipsychotic
3. Taper/discontinue antidepressants if contributing to cycling
4. Screen for hypothyroidism (treat if present)

## Mixed Episodes

### First-Line:
- Valproate
- Olanzapine
- Quetiapine
- Asenapine

### Avoid:
- Antidepressants (may worsen mixed states)

## Special Considerations

### Women of Childbearing Potential:
- **Avoid valproate** (teratogenic - neural tube defects, developmental delay)
- **Lithium**: Ebstein's anomaly risk (lower than previously thought)
- Preferred: Lamotrigine, quetiapine (weigh risks/benefits)
- High-dose folate supplementation if using mood stabilizers

### Pregnancy:
- Continue treatment if possible (untreated bipolar poses risks)
- Lithium: Use with caution; monitor levels closely (volume of distribution changes)
- Avoid valproate
- Antipsychotics: Generally continued if needed

## Psychosocial Interventions

### Evidence-Based Adjuncts:
- Psychoeducation (all patients)
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
- Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT)
- Family-focused therapy
