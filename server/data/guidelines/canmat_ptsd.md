# CANMAT PTSD Guidelines

## Overview
Evidence-based recommendations for the assessment and management of PTSD in adults in Canadian clinical settings.

## Diagnosis and Assessment
- Screen for PTSD in all patients presenting with trauma history, unexplained somatic complaints, or multiple anxiety/mood symptoms
- Validated tools: PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5), CAPS-5 (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale)
- Assess comorbidities: MDD, AUD, chronic pain, BPD, dissociative disorders

## First-Line Pharmacotherapy

### SSRIs (Level 1 Evidence)
- **Sertraline** 50-200 mg/day — FDA-approved for PTSD
- **Paroxetine** 20-60 mg/day — FDA-approved for PTSD
- **Fluoxetine** 20-60 mg/day — Level 1 evidence

### SNRIs (Level 2 Evidence)
- **Venlafaxine XR** 37.5-225 mg/day

### Prescribing Principles
- Adequate trial: 8-12 weeks at therapeutic dose
- Target all symptom clusters (intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal, negative cognitions)
- Full response may take 3-6 months
- Treatment duration: minimum 12 months after response

---

## Second-Line Pharmacotherapy

### Augmentation Strategies
- Atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine) — for partial responders, especially with hyperarousal or dissociation
- Prazosin — Level 2 evidence for PTSD-related nightmares and sleep disturbance (alpha-1 blocker)

### Adjunct Medications
- Prazosin 1-15 mg nocte: specifically for nightmare disorder associated with PTSD
- Mirtazapine: for sleep, appetite, depression comorbidity (Level 2)

---

## Third-Line and Investigational
- MAOIs (phenelzine): effective but tolerability/safety concerns
- Lamotrigine: limited evidence
- MDMA-assisted psychotherapy: Phase 3 trials (not approved in Canada)
- Ketamine: investigational for PTSD-MDD comorbidity

---

## Psychotherapy (First-Line)

### Trauma-Focused CBT
- **Prolonged Exposure (PE)** — Level 1, most evidence
- **Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)** — Level 1
- **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)** — Level 1

### Non-Trauma-Focused (Second-Line)
- Stress Inoculation Training (SIT)
- Present-Centred Therapy
- Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)

---

## Special Populations

### Combat Veterans
- High rates of TBI comorbidity — screen routinely
- May need adjunct prazosin earlier in treatment
- Peer support programs as adjunct

### Childhood Trauma / Complex PTSD
- Often presents with BPD features, affect dysregulation, dissociation
- Phase-based treatment recommended: stabilization → trauma processing → reintegration
- DBT skills training as adjunct

## Key Principles
1. Psychotherapy is first-line for uncomplicated PTSD
2. Pharmacotherapy + psychotherapy for severe, comorbid, or complex PTSD
3. Avoid benzodiazepines — evidence of worsening outcomes in PTSD
4. Substance use disorders must be addressed concurrently
5. Long-term follow-up essential — high relapse risk
