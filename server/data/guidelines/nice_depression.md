# NICE Clinical Guideline - Depression in Adults: Treatment and Management

## Stepped Care Model for Depression

### Step 1: Assessment and Psychoeducation
- Assess severity using validated tools (PHQ-9)
- Active monitoring for subthreshold/mild depression
- Psychoeducation about depression and treatment options

### Step 2: Low-Intensity Psychosocial Interventions
For persistent subthreshold or mild-moderate depression:
- Individual guided self-help (based on CBT principles)
- Computerized CBT (cCBT)
- Structured group physical activity program

### Step 3: Moderate to Severe Depression
- **High-intensity psychological intervention**: Individual CBT or IPT
- **Antidepressant medication** (if patient preference or previous good response)

### Step 4: Specialist Mental Health Services
- Complex depression
- Treatment-resistant depression
- Risk to life

## Pharmacological Treatment

### First-Line Antidepressant:
**SSRI** (considering safety, tolerability, cost)
- Sertraline recommended as first choice (evidence, cost-effectiveness, lower risk discontinuation symptoms)
- Alternatives: Citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine

### Starting Treatment:
- Discuss risks/benefits, side effects, discontinuation syndrome
- Start at standard therapeutic dose (not subtherapeutic)
- Review at 2 weeks (sooner if <30 years or increased suicide risk)
- Assess response at 4 weeks; continue to 6-8 weeks for full trial

### Inadequate Response After 4-6 Weeks:
1. **Increase dose** if tolerated and below maximum
2. **Switch to alternative SSRI** or better-tolerated antidepressant (mirtazapine, moclobemide)
3. If no response to 2 SSRIs, consider:
   - SNRI (venlafaxine, duloxetine)
   - TCA (if appropriate)
   - Mirtazapine

### Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD):
Defined as inadequate response to ≥2 antidepressants

#### Strategies:
1. **Augmentation with lithium** (monitor levels 0.6-1.0 mEq/L)
2. **Augmentation with antipsychotic**: Aripiprazole, quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone
3. **Combination antidepressants**: Mirtazapine + SSRI/SNRI
4. **Consider referral for**:
   - Psychological therapy (CBT)
   - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) - severe, life-threatening, or treatment-refractory

## Duration of Treatment

### Continuation Phase:
- Continue antidepressant for **at least 6 months** after remission
- Same dose that achieved remission

### Maintenance Phase:
- **Consider maintenance** (≥2 years) if:
  - ≥2 previous episodes of depression
  - Residual symptoms despite treatment
  - Prior episodes had significant functional impairment

### Stopping Antidepressants:
- **Gradual taper** over ≥4 weeks (longer if on for extended period or high-risk discontinuation)
- Inform patient about discontinuation symptoms
- Paroxetine, venlafaxine: Higher risk - slower taper

## Special Populations

### Elderly:
- Start at lower doses, titrate carefully
- Monitor for hyponatremia, falls
- SSRIs preferred (lower anticholinergic burden than TCAs)

### Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:
- **First-line**: High-intensity psychological therapy (CBT, IPT)
- If medication needed:
  - Weigh risks of untreated depression vs. medication
  - Avoid paroxetine (cardiac malformations)
  - Sertraline, citalopram, fluoxetine: Lower published risk data
- Neonatal adaptation syndrome possible with all antidepressants

### Psychotic Depression:
- **Antidepressant + antipsychotic combination**
- Or ECT

## Psychosocial Interventions

### Evidence-Based Therapies:
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: 16-20 sessions for moderate-severe
- **Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)**: 16-20 sessions
- **Behavioral Activation**
- **Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT)**: For relapse prevention

## Monitoring

### During Acute Treatment:
- Review at 2 weeks (initial), then at 4, 6, 8, 12 weeks
- Use PHQ-9 to track symptoms
- Monitor for suicidality (especially <30 years or high risk)
- Assess for side effects and tolerability

### Metabolic Monitoring (if on mirtazapine, TCAs, or MAOIs):
- Weight, glucose, lipids

## Risk Assessment

### Increased Suicide Risk:
- Age <30 years
- Previous self-harm
- Family history of suicide
- Comorbid substance misuse

### Actions:
- More frequent monitoring (weekly in high-risk)
- Consider restricting quantities of medication prescribed
- Involve family/caregivers with patient consent
